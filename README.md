# #30DaysOfSWA: MayTheFourth SWAG!

## Objective

It's May 4th. Let's create a simple Static Web App with a Managed Functions API using the [Azure SWAG](https://github.com/sinedied/azure-swag) template, customizing it to use quotes and images related to the Star Wars Day celebrations!!

## Steps

Here are the steps I followed to make this work!

 * Use [Azure-SWAG template](https://github.com/sinedied/azure-swag/generate) to generate [this repo](https://github.com/nitya/may4-swag)
 * Edit the [/api/quote/index.js](https://github.com/nitya/may4-swag/blob/main/api/quote/index.js) - update 
    - `quotes` with [Star Wars examples](https://www.starwars.com/news/15-star-wars-quotes-to-use-in-everyday-life)
    - `unsplashApi` query to use "star-wars"
 * Commit changes to repo
 * Use `Deploy to Azure` button to walk through SWA  quickstart using Azure Portal
 * Browse deployed site, and keep clicking!

And #MayTheFourthBeWithYou !

You can use it as a template for your own apps.

It includes a website using HTML + JavaScript and an example Node.js API.
See it live [here](https://aka.ms/swag-demo).

TL;DR:
